bash scripting coursework


Write a bash script (named as evenfruit.sh) which will support the following key functions:

a) The evenfruit.sh should be supplied with two integer arguments from command line: the starting integer and ending integer.
• If no arguments are supplied from the command line, you should use read command to ask user to input the starting and ending integers.
• If only one argument is supplied from the command line, the script should output a message alerting the user and ask for the second argument.
• If more than two arguments are supplied, the script should output a message alerting the user and choose the first two arguments.

b) Print out all even numbers between the starting number and ending number.

c) For all the even numbers, if the number is divisible by 7, print orange after the number (e.g. 14:orange).

d) For all the even numbers, if the number is divisible by 11, print banana after the number (e.g., 22:banana).

e) For all the even numbers, if the number is divisible by 13, print pear after the number (e.g., 26:pear).

f) After the list, just print out the string What is with the fruit obsession?
